Datalogics PDF Java Toolkit

The Datalogics PDF Java Toolkit is core technology
from Adobe and powers much of its server-based PDF
and forms functionality.

Overview The Datalogics PDF Java Toolkit is a
Java API, developed and refined for
years at Adobe Systems, and is now
available to application developers
and systems integrators exclusively
through Datalogics. It allows the proven
functionality of Adobe PDF and forms
capabilities to be embedded within your
custom application to automate business
workflows.

PDF Forms Support
PDF Java Toolkit includes the most
comprehensive support available for
working with all PDF form types:
AcroForm, Dynamic XFA, and Static
XFA. Use high level classes to simplify
the process of:
• Importing data to AcroForms and
XFA forms
• Exporting data from AcroForms
and XFA forms
• Flattening AcroForms

Digital Signatures
Sign or certify PDF files or validate
signed PDF documents. Create
digital signatures compliant with
PDF Advanced Electronic Signatures
(PAdES).

Additional Functionality
PDF Java Toolkit provides a broad range
of functionality for working with PDF
files, including:
• PDF creation and manipulation
• Text, image and data extraction
• Java filestream support for improved
performance
• Rich text string formatting
• PDF Portfolios and PDF Packages
• Import and export of bookmarks
and annotations in XML format
• Create PDF/A compliant documents

Reader Enablement
Reader Enablement opens up additional
functionality within the free Adobe
Reader to your users allowing them to:
• Save forms data locally
• Import or export form data
• Create or modify annotations
• Apply digital signatures
• Dynamically embed data in a 2D
barcode
• Integrate with SOAP-based web
services
